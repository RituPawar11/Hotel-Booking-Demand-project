# Hotel-Booking-Demand-project

The "Hotel Booking Demand" project aims to analyze and predict hotel booking patterns and customer behavior using the "Hotel Booking Demand" Kaggle dataset. The dataset contains various features related to hotel bookings, including booking dates, customer demographics, hotel types, booking channels, room rates, and cancellation status.

Project Steps:

1. **Data Exploration**: Load the dataset and perform initial data exploration to understand the structure, size, and basic statistics of the dataset. Explore missing values, data types, and unique values for each column.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies. Convert categorical variables to numerical format using encoding techniques like ordinal or one-hot encoding. Preprocess the data to make it suitable for model training.

3. **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations to gain insights into booking trends, cancellation rates, hotel preferences, lead time patterns, and other relevant aspects. Visualizations may include bar charts, pie charts, line plots, and histograms.

4. **Feature Engineering**: Extract additional meaningful features from existing columns if necessary. Create new features that could improve the predictive power of the model.

5. **Model Building**: Select appropriate machine learning models for the prediction task. For binary classification of booking cancellations (is_canceled), common models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting can be used.

6. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Split the data into training and testing sets. Train the selected models on the training data and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

7. **Predictions**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data to forecast booking cancellations.


The ultimate goal of the "Hotel Booking Demand" project is to help hotels make data-driven decisions, improve their operations, and optimize revenue by understanding customer behavior, identifying booking trends, and predicting future booking cancellations.
